# Postman App Support

If you have a feature request, a new integration idea, or you would like to file a bug report, please use this [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues). 

We _strongly encourage_ that you search the issue tracker to check if someone else has already reported the issue and whether there is a known solution that you can use. This would be the fastest way for you to find a solution to any issue that you are currently facing.

If you are adding a bug report, please add detailed steps to reproduce the bug, the Postman version you're using, and your OS version. Any additional files (collections, data dumps, console errors, screenshots) would be very helpful and would help us to narrow down the issue as quickly as possible. 

We have compiled a quick set of [guidelines for reporting issues](./CONTRIBUTING.md), which we encourage you to read!
